LRU Cache With TTL
Design and implement the Least Recently
Used Cache with TTL(Time To Live)
Expalnation on the eviction stragedy since
people have questions on the testcase:
1, after the record expires, it still remains in the cache.
2, when the cache reaches the capacity, it first
evicts the expried records. If there are more
than one expired records, evict the one with the minimum expire timestamp.
